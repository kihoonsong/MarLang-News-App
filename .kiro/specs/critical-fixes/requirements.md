# Critical Security Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that need immediate resolution in the MarLang News App. These fixes address urgent security risks that could compromise user data and system integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: JWT Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure JWT token handling, so that user authentication is protected from security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JWT secret is not provided THEN the system SHALL throw an error and refuse to start
2. WHEN generating JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL use only environment-provided secrets
3. WHEN JWT tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh tokens securely
4. IF no JWT_SECRET environment variable exists THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
5. WHEN tokens are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times

### Requirement 3: XSS Protection via Secure Token Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication tokens to be stored securely, so that they cannot be accessed by malicious scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I log in THEN authentication tokens SHALL be stored in HttpOnly cookies
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL NOT be accessible via JavaScript
3. WHEN I log out THEN all authentication tokens SHALL be properly cleared
4. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL have appropriate security flags (Secure, SameSite)
5. IF localStorage contains old tokens THEN they SHALL be migrated to secure storage

### Requirement 4: Memory Leak Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run smoothly without performance degradation, so that my browsing experience remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount THEN all event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN useEffect hooks run THEN they SHALL have proper cleanup functions
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN previous page resources SHALL be properly disposed
4. WHEN the app runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
5. IF memory leaks are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically reported

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when something goes wrong, so that I can continue using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN it SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN users SHALL see helpful error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the app SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN critical errors happen THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging
5. IF the app crashes THEN users SHALL see a recovery interface

### Requirement 6: API Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API rate limiting in place, so that the system is protected from abuse and excessive usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL enforce rate limits per user/IP
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN appropriate HTTP status codes SHALL be returned
3. WHEN rate limiting triggers THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
4. WHEN legitimate users hit limits THEN they SHALL receive guidance on retry timing
5. IF rate limiting fails THEN the system SHALL log the incident for investigation
