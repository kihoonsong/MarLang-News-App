# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dark mode functionality in the NEWStep application is currently not working properly. Users expect to be able to toggle between light and dark themes seamlessly, with proper visual feedback and consistent styling across all components. The dark mode should provide a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions while maintaining accessibility and usability standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark modes using a button in the navigation header, so that I can choose the theme that's most comfortable for my viewing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the dark mode toggle button THEN the application SHALL switch between light and dark themes immediately
2. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN the toggle button SHALL display a light mode icon (sun icon)
3. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN the toggle button SHALL display a dark mode icon (moon icon)
4. WHEN the user toggles the theme THEN the change SHALL be visually smooth with appropriate transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't have to re-select my preferred theme every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a theme preference THEN the application SHALL save this preference to localStorage
2. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the application SHALL load their previously selected theme preference
3. IF no theme preference is saved THEN the application SHALL default to light mode
4. WHEN the theme preference is loaded from storage THEN the application SHALL apply the theme before the first render to prevent flashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to properly support both light and dark themes, so that the interface remains consistent and readable in both modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL be readable with sufficient contrast against dark backgrounds
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all interactive elements SHALL maintain proper hover and focus states
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all cards, modals, and containers SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all icons and images SHALL remain visible and appropriately styled
5. WHEN switching themes THEN all styled-components and Material-UI components SHALL update their colors correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark mode to respect my system preferences when I first visit the application, so that the theme matches my device's settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application for the first time AND their system is set to dark mode THEN the application SHALL default to dark mode
2. WHEN a user visits the application for the first time AND their system is set to light mode THEN the application SHALL default to light mode
3. WHEN the user has previously set a theme preference THEN the application SHALL use the user's preference instead of system preference
4. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the application SHALL only update if no user preference is stored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth visual transitions when switching between themes, so that the theme change feels polished and doesn't cause visual jarring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme is toggled THEN background colors SHALL transition smoothly over 200ms
2. WHEN the theme is toggled THEN text colors SHALL transition smoothly over 200ms
3. WHEN the theme is toggled THEN the toggle button icon SHALL change with a smooth rotation or fade effect
4. WHEN the theme is toggled THEN there SHALL be no flickering or abrupt color changes
