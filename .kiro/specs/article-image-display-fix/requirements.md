# Requirements Document

## Introduction

뉴스 개별 기사 페이지에서 이미지가 표시되지 않는 문제를 해결합니다. 현재 프리렌더 HTML에서는 이미지가 정상적으로 표시되지만, React 앱이 로드된 후에는 이미지가 사라지는 현상이 발생하고 있습니다. 이는 사용자 경험을 저해하고 SEO에도 부정적인 영향을 미칩니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see article images when I visit individual article pages, so that I can have a better visual understanding of the news content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits an individual article page THEN the article image SHALL be displayed at the top of the article content
2. WHEN the article has a valid image URL THEN the image SHALL load and display properly
3. WHEN the article image fails to load THEN a fallback placeholder image SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the article has no image URL THEN no image container SHALL be shown (graceful degradation)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent image display between the prerendered HTML and React app, so that there is no visual disruption during page load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prerendered HTML shows an image THEN the React app SHALL also display the same image
2. WHEN transitioning from prerendered HTML to React app THEN there SHALL be no image flickering or disappearing
3. WHEN the React app loads THEN the image data SHALL be properly transferred from prerender data
4. WHEN image loading fails in React app THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper debugging information for image loading issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix image-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image loading fails THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged to console
2. WHEN image data is processed THEN the data transformation SHALL be logged in development mode
3. WHEN prerender data contains image information THEN the image URL and metadata SHALL be logged
4. WHEN React app processes image data THEN the processing steps SHALL be traceable through logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to load efficiently and not impact page performance, so that the article reading experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article image loads THEN it SHALL not block other page content rendering
2. WHEN multiple images are present THEN they SHALL load asynchronously
3. WHEN image loading takes time THEN a loading indicator SHALL be shown
4. WHEN images are large THEN they SHALL be properly optimized for web display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site on mobile devices, I want article images to display properly across all screen sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN images SHALL be responsive and fit the screen width
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN images SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN images SHALL be displayed at optimal size
4. WHEN device orientation changes THEN images SHALL adapt accordingly
